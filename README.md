# includes_tabulator

This tool is used to figure out which headers are included the most often, both directly and indirectly.

## Usage

Either launch the program in VS Code, which uses the `.vscode/launch.json` file, or run this command:

`python3.10 main.py input table.txt`

I used this to count the number of times headers were included in the [Cortex Command Community Project](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project), using this command:

`python3.10 main.py /home/sbos/sgoinfre/Cortex-Command-Community-Project table.txt`
